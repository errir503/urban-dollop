# Getting Started

Welcome! Let's get started building with blocks. Blocks are at the core of extending WordPress. You can create custom blocks, your own block patterns, or combine them together to build a block theme. At a high level, here are a few ways to begin your journey but read on to explore more:

- Learn more about where this work is going by [reviewing the long term roadmap](https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/).
- Explore the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/) to see the latest issues and PRs folks are working on, especially [Good First Issues](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22).
- Join the [Slack community](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) to join meetings, ongoing conversations, and more. 
- Take courses on how to use the block editor and more on [Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/). 
- Expand your knowledge by reviewing more developer docs at the overall [developer.wordpress.org resource](https://developer.wordpress.org/).
- Subscribe to [updates on Make Core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/), the main site where ongoing project updates happen.

## Ways to Stay Informed

New features and changes are important to keep up to date on as the Gutenberg project continues. Each person will have their own unique needs in keeping up with a project of this scale. What follows is more of a catalogue of ways to keep up rather than a recommendation for how to do so. 

**Yearly:**

The [WordPress.org Roadmap](https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/) with Four Phases of Gutenberg updated by project leadership. This is the highest level overview of the changes coming to WordPress.

**Monthly:**

[“What’s Next In Gutenberg?” posts](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gutenberg-next/). These updates are wrangled by the Core Editor team and highlight areas of work aligned with the Gutenberg roadmap for contributors to help, how to get involved, and more. 

[Block Based Themes Meeting](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/tags/block-based-meeting/). These meetings are currently wrangled in the #themereview Slack channel and are dedicated to sharing FSE changes that will specifically impact themes. Agendas and summaries are shared on the [Make Themes blog](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/). 

**Biweekly:**
