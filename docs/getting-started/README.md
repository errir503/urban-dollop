# Getting Started

Welcome! Let's get started building with blocks. Blocks are at the core of extending WordPress. You can create custom blocks, your own block patterns, or combine them together to build a block theme. 

## Navigating this chapter

For those starting with block development, this section is the perfect starting point as it provides the knowledge you need to start creating your own custom blocks.

- [**Block Development Environment**](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/) - Set up the right development environment to create blocks and get introduced to basic tools for block development such as [`wp-env`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env/), [`create-block`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-create-block/) and [`wp-scripts`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-create-block/)
- [**Quick Start Guide**](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/quick-start-guide/) - Get a block up and running in less than 1 min.
- [**Tutorial: Build your first block**](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/tutorial/) - The tutorial will guide you, step by step, through the complete process of creating a fully functional custom block.
- [**Fundamentals of Block Development**](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/fundamentals/) - This section provides an introduction to the most relevant concepts in Block Development.
- [**Glossary**](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/glossary/) - Glossary of terms related to the Block Editor and Full Site Editing
- [**Frequently Asked Questions**](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/) - Set of questions (and answers) that have come up from the last few years of Gutenberg development. 

## Getting Started on the WordPress project and Gutenberg

At a high level, here are a few ways to begin your journey but read on to explore more:

- Learn more about where this work is going by [reviewing the long term roadmap](https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/).
- Explore the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/) to see the latest issues and PRs folks are working on, especially [Good First Issues](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22).
- Join the [Slack community](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) to join meetings, ongoing conversations, and more. 
- Take courses on how to use the block editor and more on [Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/). 
- Expand your knowledge by reviewing more developer docs at the overall [developer.wordpress.org resource](https://developer.wordpress.org/).
- Subscribe to [updates on Make Core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/), the main site where ongoing project updates happen.

### Ways to Stay Informed

New features and changes are important to keep up to date on as the Gutenberg project continues. Each person will have their own unique needs in keeping up with a project of this scale. What follows is more of a catalogue of ways to keep up rather than a recommendation for how to do so. 

- [Keeping up with Gutenberg](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/) - compilation of Gutenberg-related team posts of Core, Core-Editor, Core-js, Core-css, Design, Meta, and Themes, and other teams.
- [“What’s New In Gutenberg?” release posts](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gutenberg-new/). These updates are wrangled by the Core Editor team and focus on what’s been released in each biweekly Gutenberg release. They include the most relevant features released and a full changelog.
- [Core Editor meetings](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-editor-summary/). These meetings are wrangled by volunteer members in the #core-editor Slack channel. [Agendas](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-editor-summary/) and [summaries](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-editor-summary/) are shared on the [Make Core blog](https://make.wordpress.org/core/). They focus on task coordination and relevant discussions around Gutenberg releases. There is an Open Floor period in each chat where people can suggest topics to discuss.
- Checking in on [issues](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pulls) on GitHub. This will give you a nearly real-time understanding of what’s being worked on by the developers and designers.
