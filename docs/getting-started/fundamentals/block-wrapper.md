# The block wrapper

Each block's markup is wrapped by a container HTML tag that needs to have the proper attributes to fully work in the Block Editor and to reflect the proper block's style settings when rendered in the Block Editor and the front end. As developers, we have full control over the block's markup, and WordPress provides the tools to add the attributes that need to exist on the wrapper to our block's markup.

Ensuring proper attributes to the block wrapper is especially important when using custom styling or features like `supports`. 

<div class="callout callout-info">
The use of <code>supports</code> generates a set of properties that need to be manually added to the wrapping element of the block so they're properly stored as part of the block data.
</div>

A block can have three sets of markup defined, each one of them with a specific target and purpose:

- The one for the **Block Editor**, defined through a `edit` React component passed to [`registerBlockType`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-registration/#registerblocktype) when registering the block in the client. 
- The one used to **save the block in the DB**, defined through a `save` function passed to `registerBlockType` when registering the block in the client. 
    - This markup will be returned to the front end on request if no dynamic render has been defined for the block.
- The one used to **dynamically render the markup of the block** returned to the front end on request, defined through the `render_callback` on [`register_block_type`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_type/) or the [`render`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#render) PHP file in `block.json`
    - If defined, this server-side generated markup will be returned to the front end, ignoring the markup stored in DB.

For the [`edit` React component and the `save` function](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-edit-save/), the block wrapper element should be a native DOM element (like `<div>`) or a React component that forwards any additional props to native DOM elements. Using a `<Fragment>` or `<ServerSideRender>` component, for instance, would be invalid.


## The Edit component's markup

The [`useBlockProps()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-block-editor/#useblockprops) hook available on the [`@wordpress/block-editor`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-block-editor) allows passing the required attributes for the Block Editor to the `edit` block's outer wrapper. 

Among other things, the `useBlockProps()` hook takes care of including in this wrapper:
- An `id` for the block's markup 
- Some accesibility and `data-` attributes
- Classes and inline styles reflecting custom settings, which include by default:
    - The `wp-block` class 
    - A class that contains the name of the block with its namespace

For example, for the following piece of code of a block's registration in the client...

```js
const Edit = () => <p { ...useBlockProps() }>Hello World - Block Editor</p>;

registerBlockType( ..., {
	edit: Edit
} );
```
_(see the [code above](https://github.com/WordPress/block-development-examples/blob/trunk/plugins/minimal-block-ca6eda/src/index.js) in [an example](https://github.com/WordPress/block-development-examples/tree/trunk/plugins/minimal-block-ca6eda))_

...the markup of the block in the Block Editor could look like this:
```html
<p 
    tabindex="0" 
    id="block-4462939a-b918-44bb-9b7c-35a0db5ab8fe" 
    role="document" 
    aria-label="Block: Minimal Gutenberg Block ca6eda" 
    data-block="4462939a-b918-44bb-9b7c-35a0db5ab8fe" 
    data-type="block-development-examples/minimal-block-ca6eda" 
    data-title="Minimal Gutenberg Block ca6eda" 
    class="
        block-editor-block-list__block 
        wp-block 
        is-selected 
        wp-block-block-development-examples-minimal-block-ca6eda
    "
>Hello World - Block Editor</p>
```

Any additional classes and attributes for the `Edit` component of the block should be passed as an argument of `useBlockProps` (see [example](https://github.com/WordPress/block-development-examples/blob/trunk/plugins/stylesheets-79a4c3/src/edit.js)). When you add `supports` for any feature, they get added to the object returned by the `useBlockProps` hook.


## The Save component's markup

When saving the markup in the DB, it’s important to add the block props returned by `useBlockProps.save()` to the wrapper element of your block. `useBlockProps.save()` ensures that the block class name is rendered properly in addition to any HTML attribute injected by the block supports API.

For example, for the following piece of code of a block's registration in the client that defines the markup desired for the DB (and returned to the front end by default)...

```js
const Edit = () => <p { ...useBlockProps() }>Hello World - Block Editor</p>;
const save = () => <p { ...useBlockProps.save() }>Hello World - Frontend</p>;

registerBlockType( ..., {
	edit: Edit,
	save,
} );
```

_(see the [code above](https://github.com/WordPress/block-development-examples/blob/trunk/plugins/minimal-block-ca6eda/src/index.js) in [an example](https://github.com/WordPress/block-development-examples/tree/trunk/plugins/minimal-block-ca6eda))_


...the markup of the block in the front end could look like this:
```html
<p class="wp-block-block-development-examples-minimal-block-ca6eda">Hello World – Frontend</p>
```

Any additional classes and attributes for the `save` function of the block should be passed as an argument of `useBlockProps.save()` (see [example](https://github.com/WordPress/block-development-examples/blob/trunk/plugins/stylesheets-79a4c3/src/save.js)). 

When you add `supports` for any feature, the proper classes get added to the object returned by the `useBlockProps.save()` hook.

```html
<p class="
    wp-block-block-development-examples-block-supports-6aa4dd 
    has-accent-4-color 
    has-contrast-background-color 
    has-text-color 
    has-background
">Hello World</p>
```

_(check the [example](https://github.com/WordPress/block-development-examples/tree/trunk/plugins/block-supports-6aa4dd) that generated the HTML above in the front end)_

## The server-side render markup

Any markup in the server-side render definition for the block can use the [`get_block_wrapper_attributes()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_block_wrapper_attributes/) function to generate the string of attributes required to reflect the block settings (see [example](https://github.com/WordPress/block-development-examples/blob/f68640f42d993f0866d1879f67c73910285ca114/plugins/block-dynamic-rendering-64756b/src/render.php#L11)). 

```php
<p <?php echo get_block_wrapper_attributes(); ?>>
	<?php esc_html_e( 'Block with Dynamic Rendering – hello!!!', 'block-development-examples' ); ?>
</p>
```
