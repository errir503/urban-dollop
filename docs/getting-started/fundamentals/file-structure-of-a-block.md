# File structure of a block

It is recommended to **register blocks within plugins** to ensure they stay available when a theme gets switched. With the `create-block` tool you can quickly scaffold the structure of the files required to create a plugin that registers a block. 

The files generated by this tool are a good reference of the files that can be involved in the definition and registration of a block.

### `<plugin-file>.php`

A block is usually added to the block editor using a WordPress plugin. In the main PHP file of the plugin the block is usually registered on the server side.

### `package.json`

[`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json) is a configuration file for a Node.js project. In this file you define the NPM dependencies of the block and the scripts used for local work.

### `src` folder

In a standard project you'll place your block files in the `src` folder. By default, the build process with `wp-scripts `will take files from this folder and will generate the bundled files in the `build` folder. 

### `block.json`

This file contains the metadata of the block, and it's used to simplify the definition and registration of the block both in the client and on the server. 

Among other data it provides properties to define the paths of the files involved in the block's behaviour, output and style. If there's a build process involved, this `block.json` along with the generated files are placed into a destination folder (usually the `build` folder) so the paths provided target to the bundled versions of these files.

The most relevant properties that can be defined in a `block.json` to set the files involved in the block's behaviour, output or style are:
- The `editorScript` property, usually set with the path of a bundled `index.js` file (output build from `src/index.js`).
- The `style` property, usually set with the path of a bundled `style-index.css` file (output build from `src/style.(css|scss|sass)`).
- The `editorStyle` property, usually set with the path of a bundled `index.css` (output build from `src/editor.(css|scss|sass)`).
- The `render` property, usually set with the path of a bundled `render.php` (output copied from `src/render.php`).
- The `viewScript` property, usually set with the path of a bundled `view.js` (output copied from `src/view.php`).

### `index.js`

The `index.js` file (or any other file defined in the `editorScript` property of `block.json`) is the entry point file for javascript that should only get loaded in the editor. It is responsible for calling the `registerBlockType` function to register the block on the client. In a standard structure it imports the `edit.js` and `save.js` files to get functions required in block registration.

### `edit.js`

The `edit.js` commonly gets used to contain the React component that gets used in the editor for our block. It usually exports a single component that then gets passed to the `edit` property of the `registerBlockType` function in the `index.js` file.

### `save.js`

The `save.js` exports the function that returns the static HTML markup that gets saved to the Database. 

### `style.(css|scss|sass)`

A `style` file with any of the extensions `.css`, `.scss` or `.sass`, contains the styles of the block that will be loaded in both the editor and the frontend. In the build process this file is converted into `style-index.css` which is usually defined at `style` property in `block.json`

</div>


### `editor.(css|scss|sass)`

An `editor` file with any of the extensions `.css`, `.scss` or `.sass`, contains the additional styles applied to the block only in the editorâ€™s context. In the build process this file is converted into `index.css` which is usually defined at `editorStyle` property in `block.json`

### `render.php`

The `render.php` file (or any other file defined in the `render` property of `block.json`) defines the server side process that returns the markup for the block when there is a request from the frontend. If this file is defined, it will take precedence over any other ways to render the block's markup for the frontend.

### `view.js`

The `view.js` file (or any other file defined in the `viewScript` property of `block.json`) will be loaded in the front-end when the block is displayed.

### `build` folder

In a standard project, the `build` folder contains the generated files in the build process triggered by the `build` or `start` commands of `wp-scripts`.
