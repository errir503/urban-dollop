# Create a block theme

The purpose of this tutorial is to show how to create a block theme and help theme developers transition to full site editing.
It is recommended that you first read the [block theme overview](/docs/how-to-guides/themes/block-theme-overview.md).

You will learn about the required files, how to combine templates and template parts, how to add presets for global styles, and how to add blocks and export the templates in the site editor.

Full site editing is an experimental feature, and the workflow in this tutorial is likely to change.

This tutorial is up to date with Gutenberg version 10.6.

## What is needed to create a block theme?

To use a block theme, you first need to activate the Gutenberg plugin.

### Required files and file structure

There are two files that are required to activate any theme: `index.php` and `style.css`.
For the plugin to recognize that a block theme is active, the theme must also include an `index.html` template
inside a folder called `block-templates`.

The theme may optionally include a `functions.php` file and a [theme.json file](/docs/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json.md) to manage global styles.
Template parts are optional. If they are included they must be placed inside a `block-template-parts` folder.

File structure:
```
theme
|__ style.css
|__ functions.php
|__ index.php
|__ theme.json
|__ block-templates
	|__ index.html
	|__ ...
|__ block-template-parts
	|__ header.html
	|__ footer.html
	|__ ...
```

## Theme setup

Create a new folder for your theme in `/wp-content/themes/`.
In this example, the folder name is `fse-tutorial`.

Inside the theme folder, create the `block-templates` and `block-template-parts` folders.

Create a `style.css` file. The file header in the `style.css` file has [the same items you would use in a classic theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/main-stylesheet-style-css/#explanations).

```CSS
/*
Theme Name: FSE Tutorial
Theme URI:
Author: The WordPress team
Author URI: https://wordpress.org/
Description:
Tags: full-site-editing, blog
Version: 1.0.0
Requires at least: 5.0
Tested up to: 5.7
Requires PHP: 7.0

Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.
*/
```

Create a blank `index.php` file. This file is used as a fallback if the theme is activated without Gutenberg.

Inside the `block-templates` folder, create a blank `index.html` file.

Optionally, create a `functions.php` file.
In this file, you can enqueue `style.css`, include additional files, enable an editor stylesheet and add theme support.

<div class="callout callout-tip">
You will add most of the theme support in the `theme.json` file. The title tag is already enabled for all block themes, and it is no longer necessarry to enqueue the comment reply script because it is included with the comments block.
</div>

```php
<?php
if ( ! function_exists( 'fse_tutorial_theme_setup' ) ) :
	/**
	 * Sets up theme defaults and registers support for various WordPress features.
	 *
	 * Note that this function is hooked into the after_setup_theme hook, which runs
	 * before the init hook. The init hook is too late for some features, such as indicating
	 * support for post thumbnails.
	 */
	function fse_tutorial_theme_setup() {
		/**
		 * Add default posts and comments RSS feed links to <head>.
		 */
		add_theme_support( 'automatic-feed-links' );

		/**
		 * Enable support for post thumbnails and featured images.
		 */
		add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );

		add_theme_support( 'editor-styles' );

		add_theme_support( 'wp-block-styles' );
	}
endif;
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'fse_tutorial_theme_setup' );

/**
 * Enqueue theme scripts and styles.
 */
function fse_tutorial_theme_scripts() {
	wp_enqueue_style( 'fse-tutorial-style', get_stylesheet_uri() );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'fse_tutorial_theme_scripts' );
```

Your theme should now include the following files and folders:

```
theme
 |__ style.css
 |__ functions.php (optional)
 |__ index.php
 |__ block-templates
 	|__ index.html
 |__ block-template-parts
 	|__ (empty folder)
```

## Creating the templates and template parts

Before continuing, install and activate your theme.

There are several ways to create templates and template parts:

- Manually, by creating HTML files containing block markup.
- Using the site editor.
- Using the template editing mode in the block editor.

The fourth way is temporary and involves going to the Appearance menu > Templates, and is not recommended because of its limitations.

### Manual template creation

Create two template part files called `header.html` and `footer.html` and place them inside the `block-template-parts` folder.

When you add blocks manually to your HTML files, start with an HTML comment that includes the block name prefixed with `wp:`.
There are both self-closing and multi-line blocks as shown in the example below.

Add the site title block to `header.html`:

```html
<!-- wp:site-title /-->
```

Add a credit text to `footer.html`:

```html
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proudly powered by <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
```

Blocks are self-containing; the opening tag and the closing tag must be in the same template.
You would not be able to place an opening tag for a group block in a header template and close it in a footer template.

Open `index.html` and include the template parts by adding two HTML comments.
The HTML comments start with `wp:template-part`, which is the name of the template part block.
Each template part is identified by the slug, the name of the file without the file extension.

Inside the HTML comment, add two curly brackets and the key, `slug`, together with the name of the template part:

```html
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header"} /-->

<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer"} /-->
```

Template parts use a `<div>` tag by default. Add the `tagName` attribute to change the HTML element to `<header>` and `<footer>`:

```html
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->

<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
```

All block attributes are placed inside these curly brackets. If you wanted the paragraph in `footer.html` to be centered, you would use the `align` attribute:

```html
<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">Proudly powered by <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
```

The HTML element that wraps the block content also uses the corresponding CSS class: `has-text-align-center`.

<div class="callout callout-tip">
If you are not sure what the correct block markup is, you can add the block in the block editor
and copy the block markup from the code editor mode to your theme files.
</div>

### Template creation in the site editor

Open the Site Editor from the WordPress admin menu. The default view is the blank index template.

Insert a new template part block. The block will have the default name "Untitled Template Part".
Open the **Advanced** section of the block settings sidebar and make the following changes:
Change the title and area to Header, and the HTML element to `<header>`.

Repeat the process for the site footer: Change the title and area to Footer, and the HTML element to `<footer>`.

Add a site title block to the header template part, and a paragraph to the footer.
Save the changes. You will be asked if you want to save the two template parts, the index template, or all three.
Confirm that the checkboxes are correct and save all three.

### Template editing mode

The template editing mode is a way to edit the website without the complexity of the site editor interface.
It is more limited than the site editor because you can not create, select or navigate between templates in this view.

You access the template editing mode via the block editor.
Create a new post or page. Next, open the document settings sidebar and locate the **Template** panel below **Status & visibility**.
Here you will find information about the current template and a list of existing templates to choose from.
Create a new template by selecting the **New** link.
Edit and save the template in the same way as in the site editor.

### Exporting

Templates and template parts that have been created or edited in the site editor or template editing mode
are saved to the database as custom post types. To export them as theme files, follow these steps:

- In the site editor, open the **More tools and options** menu.
- Select the **Export** option to download a zip file containing the files. Unpack the files.
- Copy the updated `index.html` file from `theme/block-templates/` to your theme's `block-templates` folder.
- Copy template part one and two from `theme/block-template-parts/` to your theme's `block-template-parts` folder.
- Rename the template parts to `header.html` and `footer.html`, respectively.
- Open `index.html` and update the template part slugs in the block markup.

Saved templates have precedence over theme files. To use the updated theme files, go to **Appearance > Templates** and
**Appearance > Template parts** and delete the saved templates.

### Additional templates

#### Blog

Now the theme has a basic site header and footer, but it does not display any content.
To create a list of posts, you will use the query and query loop blocks.

Whether you are using the site editor or editing theme files directly, open the index template.

First, add a group block that will work as a container for the posts.
Next, enable the width options for the blocks inside this group using `"layout":{"inherit":true}`.

```html
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->
<!-- wp:group {"layout":{"inherit":true}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group"></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
```

Change the `<div>` in the group block to a `<main>` element using the `tagName` attribute:

```html
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->
<!-- wp:group {"layout":{"inherit":true},"tagName":"main"} -->
<main class="wp-block-group"></main>
<!-- /wp:group -->
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
```

If you are using one of the editors, change the element from `<div>` to `<main>` under **Advanced** in the block setting sidebar.

Add a query block inside the group.
When you place a query block in the editor, the query loop is used as an inner block and you have the option to start with an empty loop or include selected post blocks like a post title and featured image.

Example markup:

```html
<!-- wp:query -->
<div class="wp-block-query"><!-- wp:query-loop -->
<!-- wp:post-title /-->
<!-- wp:post-date /-->
<!-- wp:post-excerpt /-->
<!-- /wp:query-loop --></div>
<!-- /wp:query -->
```

The query pagination block can only be used inside the query. Place it inside the query, but outside the loop:

```html
<!-- wp:query -->
<div class="wp-block-query"><!-- wp:query-loop -->
<!-- wp:post-title /-->
<!-- wp:post-date /-->
<!-- wp:post-excerpt /-->
<!-- /wp:query-loop -->

<!-- wp:query-pagination -->
<div class="wp-block-query-pagination">
<!-- wp:query-pagination-previous /-->
<!-- wp:query-pagination-numbers /-->
<!-- wp:query-pagination-next /--></div>
<!-- /wp:query-pagination -->

</div>
<!-- /wp:query -->
```

#### Posts and pages

Next, create a new template for displaying single posts.
If you are editing theme files directly, create a file called `single.html` inside the block-templates folder.

Add the site header and site footer template parts:

```html
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->

<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
```

Add a group block that will work as a container for your post:

```html
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->
<!-- wp:group {"tagName":"main"} -->
<main class="wp-block-group"></main>
<!-- /wp:group -->
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
```

Add your preferred blocks inside the group block. Some new blocks that are available are:

- Post content: `<!-- wp:post-content /-->`
- Post title: `<!-- wp:post-title /-->`
- Post author: `<!-- wp:post-author /-->`
- Post date: `<!-- wp:post-date /-->`
- Post featured image: `<!-- wp:post-featured-image /-->`
- Post tags: `<!-- wp:post-terms {"term":"post_tag"} /-->`
- Post categories: `<!-- wp:post-terms {"term":"category"} /-->`
- Next and previous post: `<!-- wp:post-navigation-link /--><!-- wp:post-navigation-link {"type":"previous"} /-->`

Save the HTML file, or save and export the post template if you are working in the site editor.

Copy all the blocks and create a template for displaying pages.
Optionally, save a copy of `single.html` as `page.html` inside the block-templates folder.
Adjust the blocks for the page template, and save.

#### Archives

If a theme does not have an archive or search result template, the index template will be used as a fallback.
To make sure that the query block shows the correct results, it has an attribute called `inherit`.
Inherit is enabled by default and filters the query depending on the page that you are viewing.

If you like you can continue creating an archive or category template by copying the index file and
adding a title using the archive title block. This is a variation of the query title block:
`<!-- wp:query-title {"type":"archive"} /-->`

## Theme.json - Global styles

`theme.json` is a configuration file used to enable or disable features and set default styles for both the website and blocks.

Style settings are converted to CSS custom properties and enqueued for the editor and the front,
reducing the need for the theme to enqueue block styles.

To make the most out of this tutorial, read the [documentation for global styles](/docs/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json.md).

[Learn more about the JSON format (external link)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)

Create a file called `theme.json` and save it inside the main theme folder.

Start by adding two curly brackets to the file:

```json
{

}
```

Add the version number for the theme.json format. For Gutenberg 10.6, the version number is 1:

```json
{
	"version": 1,
}
```

Next, add three main sections:

- Settings -Where you will enable features and create presets for styles.
- Styles -Where you apply styles to the website, elements, and blocks.
- templateParts -For assigning template part files to template areas.

```json
{
	"version": 1,
	"settings": {
	},
	"styles": {
	},
	"templateParts": [
	]
}
```

Remember to separate the objects with a comma.

### Enabling and disabling features

For a list of features that can be enabled or disabled, see the [documentation for theme.json](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/#settings).

There are two different ways that a block can support a feature:

- By displaying a control in the block settings sidebar.
- By allowing defaults to be set using `theme.json`.

<div class="callout callout-tip">
It is not possible to add controls to a block that does not support them by using theme.json.
</div>

Example:
A block that does not have support for border controls, can have a default border set inside the `theme.json` file,
as long as the border feature is enabled.

To enable border styles, add a `border` object under `settings` with the following attributes and values:

```json
{
	"version": 1,
	"settings": {
		"border": {
			"customColor": true,
			"customRadius": true,
			"customStyle": true,
			"customWidth": true
		}
	}
}
```

To enable link colors, add a `color` setting and set `link` to true:

```json
{
	"version": 1,
	"settings": {
		"border": {
			"customColor": true,
			"customRadius": true,
			"customStyle": true,
			"customWidth": true
		},
		"color": {
			"link": true,
		}
	}
}
```

To enable padding and custom spacing units, include a setting for spacing:

```json
{
	"version": 1,
	"settings": {
		"border": {
			"customColor": true,
			"customRadius": true,
			"customStyle": true,
			"customWidth": true
		},
		"color": {
			"link": true
		},
		"spacing": {
			"customPadding": true,
			"units": [ "px", "em", "rem", "vh", "vw" ]
		}
	}
}
```

#### Disabling features

If you want to disable gradients, which are enabled by default, set `gradient` to false:

```json
{
	"version": 1,
	"settings": {
		"border": {
			"customColor": true,
			"customRadius": true,
			"customStyle": true,
			"customWidth": true
		},
		"color": {
			"link": true,
			"gradient": false
		}
		...
	}
}
```



### Content width and theme support for wide and full-width blocks

The `layout` setting enables width settings for group blocks and template parts
and replaces `add_theme_support( 'align-wide' );`.

The benefit of enabling the layout setting in `theme.json` is that you no longer need to add extra CSS for
block alignments or widths. You can also set more precise widths to blocks inside containers.

The keys used by `layout` are:

- `contentSize` Default width for the blocks.
- `wideSize` Wide width.

The example uses pixels, but you can use any valid CSS value and unit.
(The code example is truncated to illustrate where to add the option.)

```json
{
	"version": 1,
	"settings": {
		...
		"layout": {
			"contentSize": "840px",
			"wideSize": "1100px"
		}
	}
}
```

### Color palette

This is the equivalent of `add_theme_support( 'editor-color-palette' )`.
You can add multiple color palettes: a default palette for all blocks, and color palettes specific to a block type.

The keys used by `palette` are:

- `slug` A unique identifier for the color.
- `color` The hex color value.
- `name` The visible name in the editor. Optional.

Multiple colors are added as an array using square brackets: `[]`.
Add a default color palette inside `settings`, under `color`:

```json
{
	"version": 1,
	"settings": {
		...
		"color": {
			"palette": [
				{
					"slug": "white",
					"color": "#fff",
					"name": "White"
				},
				{
					"slug": "blue",
					"color": "#0073AA",
					"name": "WordPress blue"
				},
				{
					"slug": "dark-grey",
					"color": "#23282D",
					"name": "Dark grey"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Next, add a trailing comma after `color`, and add a new palette for the heading block.
This palette will override the default theme palette.

```json
"blocks": {
	"core/heading": {
		"color": {
			"palette": [
				{
					"slug": "white",
					"color": "#fff",
					"name": "White"
				},
				{
					"slug": "medium-blue",
					"color": "#00A0D2",
					"name": "Medium blue"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Presets are created under `settings` and applied under `styles`.
Apply the white color to the body background by adding `color` followed by the `background` key and value:

```json
"styles": {
	"color": {
		"background": "var(--wp--preset--color--white)"
	}
}
```

### Typography

To add custom font sizes, create a new section called `typography` under `settings`.
`fontSizes` is the equivalent of `add_theme_support( 'editor-font-sizes' )`.

```json
"typograhy": {
	"fontSizes": [
	]
}
```

The keys used by `fontSizes` are:

- `slug` A unique identifier for the size.
- `size` The size value. This can be unitless or use any valid CSS value.
- `name` The visible name in the editor.

```json
"typograhy": {
	"fontSizes": [
		{
			"slug": "normal",
			"size": "20px",
			"name": "normal"
		},
		{
			"slug": "extra-small",
			"size": "16px",
			"name": "Extra small"
		},
		{
			"slug": "large",
			"size": "24px",
			"name": "Large"
		}
	]
}
```

To apply a size to a block, follow these steps:
Create a new section called `blocks` under `styles`

```json
"blocks": {

}
```

Add the names of the blocks that you want to set defaults for

```json
"blocks": {
	"core/paragraph": {
	},
	"core/post-terms": {
	},
	"core/post-title": {
	}
}
```

Add the `typography` setting, and set the `fontSize` value to the preset that you created

```json
"blocks": {
	"core/paragraph": {
		"typography": {
			"fontSize": "var(--wp--preset--font-size--normal)"
		}
	},
	"core/post-terms": {
		"typography": {
			"fontSize": "var(--wp--preset--font-size--extra-small)"
		}
	},
	"core/post-title": {
		"typography": {
			"fontSize": "var(--wp--preset--font-size--large)"
		}
	}
}
```

### Elements

With the `elements` setting, you can set defaults for links and headings on the website and inside blocks.

#### Elements on the website

Set a font color to all `<H2>` headings, regardless of if the heading is a site title, post title, or heading block:

```json
"styles": {
	"elements": {
		"h2": {
			"color": {
				"text": "var(--wp--preset--color--medium-blue)"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Add a default link text color:

```json
"styles": {
	"elements": {
		"h2": {
			"color": {
				"text": "var(--wp--preset--color--medium-blue)"
			}
		},
		"link": {
			"color": {
				"text": "var(--wp--preset--color--dark-grey)"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

#### Elements inside blocks

Some blocks have more than one element, or have different elements depending on settings.

Example: If you set a background color to a post excerpt block, that background affects the entire block.
You can set a background to the optional "read more" link in the post excerpt block using elements:
`Styles > blocks > the name of the block > elements > element > attribute`

Since the theme has custom padding enabled, you can add `padding` within the `spacing` attribute to make the background color more visible:

```JSON
"styles": {
	"blocks": {
		"core/post-excerpt": {
			"elements": {
				"link": {
					"color": {
						"text": "var(--wp--preset--color--white)",
						"background": "var(--wp--preset--color--blue)"
					},
					"spacing": {
						"padding": {
							"top": "1em",
							"right": "1em",
							"bottom": "1em",
							"left": "1em"
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Template parts

In the templeParts section, assign the two template parts that you created to their template areas.
Add two keys:
-`name`, the file name of the template part file without the file extension,
-`area`, the name of the template area.

There are three template areas to choose from: Header, footer, and general.

```json
"templateParts": [
	{
		"name": "header",
		"area": "header"
	},
	{
		"name": "footer",
		"area": "footer"
	}
]
```

## Custom templates

Custom templates for posts, pages, and custom post types are created by adding additional HTML files inside the
`block-templates` folder.
In a classic theme, templates are identified with a file header. In a block theme, you list templates in the `theme.json` file.

All templates that are listed in the `customTemplates` section of `theme.json` are selectable in the site editor.

For templates to be editable in the template editing mode, the template's file name needs to be prefixed with either `post-` or `page-`.

First, create a section called `customTemplates` at the root level of `theme.json`.
This section has two required keys:
`Name`, which is the name of the template file without the file ending.
`title`, which is the visible title of the template in the editors.

```json
"customTemplates": [
	{
		"name": "page-home",
		"title": "Page without title"
	}
]
```

There is also an optional setting where you decide which post types that can use the template.
The key is `postTypes`, followed by the name of the post type:

```json
"customTemplates": [
	{
		"name": "page-home",
		"title": "Page without title"
	},
	{
		"name": "page-contact",
		"title": "Contact",
		"postTypes": [
			"page"
		]
	}
]
```

## Example themes

You can find a basic starter theme called "emptytheme" and other example themes
on the [Experimental themes GitHub repository](https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments).
When using a theme as reference, take note of which Gutenberg version the theme is built for,
because the experimental features are updated frequently.

The theme directory lists block themes under the tag [full site editing](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/).
