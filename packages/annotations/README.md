_This package assumes that your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for such language features and APIs, you should include [the polyfill shipped in `@wordpress/babel-preset-default`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-preset-default#polyfill) in your code._

## Getting Started

You need to include `wp-annotations` as a dependency of the JavaScript file in which you wish to use the Annotations API.

## Usage

[See this page for more detailed usage instructions](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/block-api/block-annotations).
