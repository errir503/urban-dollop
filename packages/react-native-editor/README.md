# React Native Editor

This package provides a demo application to simplify the environment setup required for the development of Gutenberg for native Android and iOS. The demo application allows running the mobile versions of Gutenberg blocks while avoiding the additional setup steps required by the [WordPress Android](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android) and [Wordpress iOS](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS) apps.

## Getting Started

Please review [Getting Started for the React Native based Mobile Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/docs/contributors/code/react-native/getting-started-react-native.md) to learn how to set up and run this demo application.
