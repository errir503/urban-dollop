# First Time Contributor Account Link

Prompts the user to link their GitHub account to their WordPress.org profile if necessary for release notes credit.

## Rationale

A person's first contribution to the project is an exciting moment worth celebrating.

Rate of new contributorship can be a potential metric of a project's open-source health.

Compiling credits for release notes of a WordPress release [requires that a person's WordPress.org profile can be associated with a GitHub account](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/19/associating-github-accounts-with-wordpress-org-profiles/). This is not an obvious requirement for new contributors, and it should be brought to their attention at the earliest opportunity in their contributing journey.
