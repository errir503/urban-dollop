## Unreleased

## 6.1.0 (2021-11-07)

### New Features

-   Added new block icons: `commentAuthorAvatar`, `commentAuthorName`, `commentContent` and `commentReplyLink` ([#36171](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36171)).

## 6.0.0 (2021-10-12)

### Breaking Change

-   Removed the `minus` icon, which was only used once in the block editor, in favor of the new `reset` icon which offers a more refined vector.

## 5.0.0 (2021-07-29)

### Breaking Change

-   Upgraded React components to work with v17.0 ([#29118](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29118)). There are no new features in React v17.0 as explained in the [blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/10/20/react-v17.html).

## 4.1.0 (2021-07-21)

## 4.0.0 (2021-05-20)

### Breaking Changes

-   Removed icons: `camera`, `chartLine`, `closeCircleFilled`, `controlsRepeat`, `expand`, as they all have better existing alternatives, and were unused by the block editor. Instead of `camera`, use `capturePhoto`. Instead of `chartLine`, use `chartBar` or `trendingUp` or `trendingDown`, instead of `closeCircleFilled`, use `close`, instead of `controlsRepeat` which was used for Reusable Blocks, consider `reusableBlock`, and instead of `expand`, use `fullscreen`.
