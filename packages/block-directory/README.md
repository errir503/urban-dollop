# Block directory

Package used to extend editor with block directory features to search and install blocks.

> This package is meant to be used only with WordPress core. Feel free to use it in your own project but please keep in mind that it might never get fully documented.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/block-directory --save
```

_This package assumes that your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for such language features and APIs, you should include [the polyfill shipped in `@wordpress/babel-preset-default`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-preset-default#polyfill) in your code._

## Usage

This package builds a standalone JS file. When loaded on a page with the block editor, it extends the block inserter to search for blocks from WordPress.org.

To do this, it uses the `__unstableInserterMenuExtension`, a slot-fill area hooked into the block types list. When the user runs a search and there are no results currently installed, it fires off a request to WordPress.org for matching blocks. These are listed for the user to install with a one-click process that [installs, activates, and injects the block into the post.](./src/store/actions.js#L49) When the post is saved, if the block was not used, it will be [silently uninstalled](./src/store/actions.js#L129) to avoid clutter.

See also the API endpoints for searching WordPress.org: `/wp/v2/block-directory/search`, and installing & activating plugins: `/wp/v2/plugins/`.
