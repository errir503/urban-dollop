# List Reusable blocks

Package used to add import/export links to the listing page of the reusable blocks.

> This package is meant to be used only with WordPress core. Feel free to use it in your own project but please keep in mind that it might never get fully documented.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/list-reusable-blocks --save
```

_This package assumes that your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES2015+ such as IE browsers then using [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) will add polyfills for these methods._
