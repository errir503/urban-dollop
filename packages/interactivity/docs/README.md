# Interactivity API Docs

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Welcome to the Interactivity API documentation.


> Interactivity API is a current [proposal](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/) that **is only available in Gutenberg** at the moment and not in WordPress Core as it is still very experimental, and very likely to change.

> As part of an [Open Source project](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/faq/#the-gutenberg-project) we encourage participation in helping shape this API and its Docs. The [discussions](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/categories/interactivity-api) and [issues](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/%5BFeature%5D%20Interactivity%20API) in GitHub are the best place to engage.


## Quick start

The best place to start with the Interactivity API is this [**Getting started guide**](1-getting-started.md). There you'll will find a very quick start guide and the current requirements of the Interactivity API.

## Take a deep dive

At the [**API Reference**](2-api-reference.md) page you'll find detailed technical descriptions for the *Directives* and *Store* which are the main elements of the Interactivity API.

You can also check [Getting Started - and other learning resources](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/52894) among other [discussions in GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/categories/interactivity-api) to learn more on this proposal.

## Get Involved

Feel free to open pull requests to improve any part of these docs, or to add other sections or files to the docs.

If you are willing to help with the documentation, please add a comment to [#51928](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/51928), and we'll coordinate everyone's efforts.

There's a Tracking Issue opened to ease the coordination of the work related to the Interactivity API Docs: **[Documentation for the Interactivity API - Tracking Issue #53296](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53296)**
