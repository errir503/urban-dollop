# Component Reference

This package includes a library of generic WordPress components to be used for creating common UI elements shared between screens and features of the WordPress dashboard.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/components --save
```

_This package assumes that your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES2015+ such as IE browsers then using [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) will add polyfills for these methods._

## Usage

Within Gutenberg, these components can be accessed by importing from the `components` root directory:

```jsx
/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import { Button } from '@wordpress/components';

export default function MyButton() {
	return <Button>Click Me!</Button>;
}
```

Many components include CSS to add style, you will need to add in order to appear correctly. Within WordPress, add the `wp-components` stylesheet as a dependency of your plugin's stylesheet. See [wp_enqueue_style documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/#parameters) for how to specify dependencies.

In non-WordPress projects, link to the `build-style/style.css` file directly, it is located at `node_modules/@wordpress/components/build-style/style.css`.
