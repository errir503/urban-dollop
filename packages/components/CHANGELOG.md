## 14.2.0 (2021-07-21)

### New Feature

-   Update the border color used in `CardBody`, `CardHeader`, `CardFooter`, and `CardDivider` to a different shade of gray, in order to match the color used in other components ([#32566](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32566)).

### Deprecation

-   `isPrimary`, `isSecondary`, `isTertiary` and `isLink` props in `Button` have been deprecated. Use `variant` instead ([#31713](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31713)).
-   `isElevated` prop in `Card` has been deprecated. Use `elevation` instead ([#32566](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32566)).

## 13.0.0 (2021-03-17)

### Breaking Change

-   `onChange` prop of `FocalPointPicker` is called at the end of drag operations. Previously, it was called repetitively while dragging.

### New Feature

-   Supports ref forwarding in `withNotices` and `ResizableBox`.
-   Adds `onDrag` prop of `FocalPointPicker`.

### Bug Fix

-   Allows focus of the `FocalPointPicker` draggable area and adjustment with arrow keys. This was added in [#22531](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/22264) but was no longer working.

## 12.0.0 (2020-12-17)

### Enhancements

-   ComboboxControl: Deburr option labels before filter

### Breaking Change

-   Introduce support for other units and advanced CSS properties on `FontSizePicker`. Provided the value passed to the `FontSizePicker` is a string or one of the size options passed is a string, onChange will start to be called with a string value instead of a number. On WordPress usage, font size options are now automatically converted to strings with the default "px" unit added.

## 10.1.0 (2020-09-03)

### New Feature

-   Add `ToolbarItem` component.
-   Support `label` prop on the `Toolbar` component.

## 10.0.0 (2020-07-07)

### Breaking Change

-   `NumberControl` no longer automatically transforms values when rendering `value` into a `<input />` HTML element.
-   `Dashicon` component no longer renders SVGs. If you rely on this component, make sure to load the dashicon font.

## 9.6.0 (2020-05-14)

### Bug Fix

-   Fix and issue that would cause the `Popover` component to throw an error under certain
    circumstances ([#22264](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/22264)).

### Deprecations

-   The `Guide` component no longer supports passing pages as children. Use the `pages` prop instead.
-   The `GuidePage` component is deprecated. Use the `pages` prop in `Guide` instead.

## 9.2.0 (2020-02-10)

### Enhancements

-   The `Notice` component will speak its message. With this new feature, a developer can control either the `spokenMessage` spoken message, or the `politeness` politeness level of the message.
-   The `Snackbar` component will speak its message. With this new feature, a developer can control either the `spokenMessage` spoken message, or the `politeness` politeness level of the message.
-   A `Notice` `actions` member can now assign `isPrimary` to render a primary button action associated with a notice message.

### Bug Fixes

-   Notice will assume a default status of 'info' if none is provided. This resolves an issue where the notice would be assigned a class name `is-undefined`. This was previously the effective default by styled appearance and should not be considered a breaking change in that regard.

## 9.0.0 (2020-01-13)

### New Features

-   Added a new `Guide` component which allows developers to easily present a user guide.

### Breaking Changes

-   `is-button` classname has been removed from the Button component.
-   The `is-default` classname is not applied automatically anymore.
-   By default Button components come with a fixed height and hover styles.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixes a regression published in version 8.5.0 that would prevent some build tools from including
    styles provided in the packages build-styles directory.

### Deprecations

-   `isDefault` prop in `Button` has been deprecated. Consider using `isSecondary` instead.
-   `IconButton` has been deprecated. Use the `Button` component instead.

## 8.2.0 (2019-08-29)

### New Features

-   The bundled `re-resizable` dependency has been updated from requiring `5.0.1` to requiring `^6.0.0` ([#17011](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/17011)).

## 8.1.0 (2019-08-05)

### New Features

-   Added a new `popoverProps` prop to the `Dropdown` component which allows users of the `Dropdown` component to pass props directly to the `Popover` component.
-   Added and documented `hideLabelFromVision` prop to `BaseControl` used by `SelectControl`, `TextControl`, and `TextareaControl`.
-   Added a new `popoverProps` prop to the `DropdownMenu` component which allows to pass props directly to the nested `Popover` component.
-   Added a new `toggleProps` prop to the `DropdownMenu` component which allows to pass props directly to the nested `IconButton` component.
-   Added a new `menuProps` prop to the `DropdownMenu` component which allows to pass props directly to the nested `NavigableMenu` component.

### Deprecations

-   `menuLabel` prop in `DropdownComponent` has been deprecated. Consider using `menuProps` object and its `aria-label` property instead.
-   `position` prop in `DropdownComponent` has been deprecated. Consider using `popoverProps` object and its `position` property instead.

### Bug Fixes

-   The `Button` component will no longer assign default styling (`is-default` class) when explicitly assigned as primary (the `isPrimary` prop). This should resolve potential conflicts affecting a combination of `isPrimary`, `isDefault`, and `isLarge` / `isSmall`, where the busy animation would appear with incorrect coloring.

### Deprecations

-   The `Popover` component `onClickOutside` prop has been deprecated. Use `onFocusOutside` instead.

### Internal

-   The `Dropdown` component has been refactored to focus changes using the `Popover` component's `onFocusOutside` prop.
-   The `MenuItem` component will now always use an `IconButton`. This prevents a focus loss when clicking a menu item.
-   Package no longer depends on external `react-click-outside` library.

## 8.0.0 (2019-06-12)

### New Feature

-   Add new `BlockQuotation` block to the primitives folder to support blockquote in a multiplatform way. [#15482](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15482).
-   `DropdownMenu` now supports passing a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#using-props-other-than-render) as children for more advanced customization.

### Internal

-   `MenuGroup` no longer uses `NavigableMenu` internally. It needs to be explicitly wrapped with `NavigableMenu` to bring back the same behavior.

### Documentation

-   Added missing documentation for `DropdownMenu` props `menuLabel`, `position`, `className`.

### Breaking Change

-   `ServerSideRender` is no longer part of components. It was extracted to an independent package `@wordpress/server-side-render`.

### Bug Fix

-   Although `DateTimePicker` does not allow picking the seconds, passed the current seconds as the selected value for seconds when calling `onChange`. Now it passes zero.

-   Added a new `Snackbar` component.

### Bug Fix

-   Added a new `anchorRect` prop to `Popover` which enables a developer to provide a custom `DOMRect` object at which to position the popover.

### Improvements

-   Limit `Base Control Label` to the width of its content.

### Bug fixes

-   Fix `instanceId` prop passed through to `Button` component via `MenuItems` producing React console error. Fixed by removing the unnecessary use of `withInstanceId` on the `MenuItems` component [#14599](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14599)

## 7.2.0 (2019-03-20)

### Improvements

## 7.1.0 (2019-03-06)

### New Features

-   Added a new `Animate` component.

### Improvements

-   `withFilters` has been optimized to avoid binding hook handlers for each mounted instance of the component, instead using a single centralized hook delegator.

-   Allow years between 0 and 1970 in DateTime component.
