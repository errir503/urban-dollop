-   ComboboxControl: Deburr option labels before filter

### Breaking Change

-   Introduce support for other units and advanced CSS properties on `FontSizePicker`.

### New Feature

-   Add `ToolbarItem` component.
-   Support `label` prop on the `Toolbar` component.

### Deprecations

-   The `GuidePage` component is deprecated. Use the `pages` prop in `Guide` instead.

## 9.2.0 (2020-02-10)

### Enhancements

-   The `Notice` component will speak its message. With this new feature, a developer can control either the `spokenMessage` spoken message, or the `politeness` politeness level of the message.

-   A `Notice` `actions` member can now assign `isPrimary` to render a primary button action associated with a notice message.

### Bug Fixes

-   Notice will assume a default status of 'info' if none is provided. This resolves an issue where the notice would be assigned a class name `is-undefined`. This was previously the effective default by styled appearance and should not be considered a breaking change in that regard.

## 9.0.0 (2020-01-13)

### New Features

-   Added a new `Guide` component which allows developers to easily present a user guide.

### Breaking Changes

-   `is-button` classname has been removed from the Button component.

-   Fixes a regression published in version 8.5.0 that would prevent some build tools from including
    styles provided in the packages build-styles directory.

### Deprecations

-   `isDefault` prop in `Button` has been deprecated. Consider using `isSecondary` instead.
-   `IconButton` has been deprecated. Use the `Button` component instead.

## 8.2.0 (2019-08-29)

### New Features

-   The bundled `re-resizable` dependency has been updated from requiring `5.0.1` to requiring `^6.0.0` ([#17011](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/17011)).

## 8.1.0 (2019-08-05)

### New Features

-   Added a new `popoverProps` prop to the `Dropdown` component which allows users of the `Dropdown` component to pass props directly to the `Popover` component.
-   Added and documented `hideLabelFromVision` prop to `BaseControl` used by `SelectControl`, `TextControl`, and `TextareaControl`.
-   Added a new `popoverProps` prop to the `DropdownMenu` component which allows to pass props directly to the nested `Popover` component.
-   Added a new `toggleProps` prop to the `DropdownMenu` component which allows to pass props directly to the nested `IconButton` component.
-   Added a new `menuProps` prop to the `DropdownMenu` component which allows to pass props directly to the nested `NavigableMenu` component.

### Deprecations

-   `menuLabel` prop in `DropdownComponent` has been deprecated. Consider using `menuProps` object and its `aria-label` property instead.
-   `position` prop in `DropdownComponent` has been deprecated. Consider using `popoverProps` object and its `position` property instead.

### Bug Fixes

-   The `Button` component will no longer assign default styling (`is-default` class) when explicitly assigned as primary (the `isPrimary` prop). This should resolve potential conflicts affecting a combination of `isPrimary`, `isDefault`, and `isLarge` / `isSmall`, where the busy animation would appear with incorrect coloring.

### Deprecations

-   The `Popover` component `onClickOutside` prop has been deprecated. Use `onFocusOutside` instead.

### Internal

-   The `Dropdown` component has been refactored to focus changes using the `Popover` component's `onFocusOutside` prop.
-   The `MenuItem` component will now always use an `IconButton`. This prevents a focus loss when clicking a menu item.
-   Package no longer depends on external `react-click-outside` library.

## 8.0.0 (2019-06-12)

### New Feature

-   Add new `BlockQuotation` block to the primitives folder to support blockquote in a multiplatform way. [#15482](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15482).
-   `DropdownMenu` now supports passing a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#using-props-other-than-render) as children for more advanced customization.

### Internal

-   `MenuGroup` no longer uses `NavigableMenu` internally. It needs to be explicitly wrapped with `NavigableMenu` to bring back the same behavior.

### Documentation

-   Added missing documentation for `DropdownMenu` props `menuLabel`, `position`, `className`.

### Breaking Change

-   `ServerSideRender` is no longer part of components. It was extracted to an independent package `@wordpress/server-side-render`.

### Bug Fix

-   Although `DateTimePicker` does not allow picking the seconds, passed the current seconds as the selected value for seconds when calling `onChange`. Now it passes zero.

### New Feature

-   Added a new `HorizontalRule` component.
-   Added a new `Snackbar` component.

### Bug Fix

### Improvements

-   Limit `Base Control Label` to the width of its content.

### Bug fixes
