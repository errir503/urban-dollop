# Animate

Simple interface to introduce animations to components.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Animate } from '@wordpress/components';

const MyAnimatedNotice = () => (
	<Animate type="slide-in" options={ { origin: 'top' } }>
		{ ( { className } ) => (
			<Notice className={ className } status="success">
				<p>Animation finished.</p>
			</Notice>
		) }
	</Animate>
);
```

## Available Animation Types

### appear

This animation is meant for popover/modal content, such as menus appearing. It shows the height and width of the animated element scaling from 0 to full size, from its point of origin.

#### Options

| Name     | Type     | Default      | Description                                                          |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `origin` | `string` | `top center` | Point of origin (`top`, `bottom`,` middle right`, `left`, `center`). |

### loading

This animation is meant to be used to indicate that activity is happening in the background. It is an infinitely-looping fade from 50% to full opacity. This animation has no options, and should be removed as soon as its relevant operation is completed.

### slide-in

This animation is meant for sidebars and sliding menus. It shows the height and width of the animated element moving from a hidden position to its normal one.

#### Options

| Name     | Type     | Default | Description               |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| `origin` | `string` | `left`  | Point of origin (`left`). |
