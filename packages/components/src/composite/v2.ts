/**
 * Composite is a component that may contain navigable items represented by
 * CompositeItem. It's inspired by the WAI-ARIA Composite Role and implements
 * all the keyboard navigation mechanisms to ensure that there's only one
 * tab stop for the whole Composite element. This means that it can behave as
 * a roving tabindex or aria-activedescendant container.
