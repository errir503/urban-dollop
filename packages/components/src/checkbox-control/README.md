### Usage

#### When to use checkboxes

Use checkboxes when you want users to:

-   Select one or multiple items from a list.
-   Open a list containing sub-selections.

**Do**
Use checkboxes when users can select multiple items from a list. They let users select more than one item.

**Don’t**
Don’t use toggles when a list consists of multiple options. Use checkboxes — they take up less space.

Checkboxes can be used to open a list containing sub-selections.

#### Parent and child checkboxes

Checkboxes can have a parent-child relationship, with secondary options nested under primary options.

When the parent checkbox is _checked_, all the child checkboxes are checked. When a parent checkbox is _unchecked_, all the child checkboxes are unchecked.

If only a few child checkboxes are checked, the parent checkbox becomes a mixed checkbox.
