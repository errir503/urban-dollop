## Unreleased

## 8.0.0 (2021-11-07)

### Performance

-   Avoid re-rendering all List View items on block focus [#35706](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35706). When List View is open Block focus time is 4 times faster in large posts.
-   Render fixed number of items in List View [#35706](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35230). Opening List View is 13 times faster in large posts.

### Breaking change

-   List View no longer supports the `showOnlyCurrentHierarchy` flag [#35706](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35706). To display a subset of blocks, use the `blocks` parameter instead.

## 7.0.0 (2021-07-29)

### Breaking Change

-   Upgraded React components to work with v17.0 ([#29118](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29118)). There are no new features in React v17.0 as explained in the [blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/10/20/react-v17.html).

## 6.2.0 (2021-07-21)

### New Features

-   `ButtonBlockerAppender` is now `ButtonBlockAppender`, the original name was a typo, but is still being exported for backward compatibility.

## 6.1.0 (2021-05-20)

## 6.0.0 (2021-05-14)

### Breaking Changes

-   Drop support for Internet Explorer 11 ([#31110](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31110)). Learn more at https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/04/22/ie-11-support-phase-out-plan/.
-   Increase the minimum Node.js version to v12 matching Long Term Support releases ([#31270](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31270)). Learn more at https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/.

## 5.3.0 (2021-03-17)

-   Add `JustifyToolbar` component abstracted out of the Navigation block so can be used elsewhere.

## 5.2.0 (2020-12-17)

### New Feature

-   Added a store definition `store` for the block editor namespace to use with `@wordpress/data` API ([#26655](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/26655)).

## 5.0.0 (2020-10-06)

### Breaking Changes

-   The block editor does not contain default colors, gradients, and font sizes anymore. If one wants to take advantage of these features, please explicitly pass colors, gradients, and/or settings or use the new \_\_experimentalFeatures setting that is available.

## 4.0.0 (2020-05-28)

### Breaking Changes

-   The block control value for `InnerBlocks` has been changed from `__experimentalBlocks` to `value` and is now considered a stable API.
-   Removed the `utility` property from the objects returned by the `getInserterItems` selector.

## 3.7.0 (2020-02-10)

### New Features

-   Add new `__experimentalEditorSkeleton` component. This has been moved over from the `@wordpress/edit-post` package, where it was an internal component called `EditorRegions`. Its class names have thus been renamed from `edit-post-editor-regions` to `block-editor-editor-skeleton`.

## 3.3.0 (2019-11-14)

### New Features

-   Added a `label` prop to `URLInput`. This allows the label to be set without needing to wrap the `URLInput` in a `BaseControl`.

### Deprecation

-   `dropZoneUIOnly` prop in `MediaPlaceholder` component has been deprecated in favor of `disableMediaButtons` prop.

## 3.0.0 (2019-08-05)

### New Features

-   Added a new `allowedFormats` prop to `RichText` to fine tune allowed formats. Deprecated the `formattingControls` prop in favour of this. Also added a `withoutInteractiveFormatting` to specifically disable format types that would insert interactive elements, which can not be nested.

### Breaking Changes

-   `BlockEditorProvider` no longer renders a wrapping `SlotFillProvider` or `DropZoneProvider` (from `@wordpress/components`). For custom block editors, you should render your own as wrapping the `BlockEditorProvider`. A future release will include a new `BlockEditor` component for simple, standard usage. `BlockEditorProvider` will serve the simple purpose of establishing its own context for block editors.

## 2.2.0 (2019-06-12)

### Internal

-   Refactored `BlockSettingsMenu` to use `DropdownMenu` from `@wordpress/components`.

## 2.0.0 (2019-04-16)

### New Features

-   Added the `addToGallery` property to the `MediaUpload` interface. The property allows users to open the media modal in the `gallery-library`instead of `gallery-edit` state.
-   Added the `addToGallery` property to the `MediaPlaceholder` component. The component passes the property to the `MediaUpload` component used inside the placeholder.
-   Added the `isAppender` property to the `MediaPlaceholder` component. The property changes the look of the placeholder to be adequate to scenarios where new files are added to an already existing set of files, e.g., adding files to a gallery.
-   Added the `dropZoneUIOnly` property to the `MediaPlaceholder` component. The property makes the `MediaPlaceholder` only render a dropzone without any other additional UI.
-   Added a cancel link to the list of buttons in the `MediaPlaceholder` component which appears if an `onCancel` handler exists.
-   Added the usage of `mediaPreview` for the `Placeholder` component to the `MediaPlaceholder` component.
-   Added a an `onDoubleClick` event handler to the `MediaPlaceholder` component.
-   Added a way to pass special `ref` property to the `PlainText` component.
-   The `URLPopover` component now passes through all unhandled props to the underlying Popover component.

### Breaking Changes

-   `CopyHandler` will now only catch cut/copy events coming from its `props.children`, instead of from anywhere in the `document`.

### Internal

-   Improved handling of blocks state references for unchanging states.
-   Updated handling of blocks state to effectively ignored programmatically-received blocks data (e.g. reusable blocks received from editor).

## 1.0.0 (2019-03-06)

### New Features

-   Initial version.
