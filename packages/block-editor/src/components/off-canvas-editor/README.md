# Off Canvas Editor

The OffCanvasEditor component is a modified ListView compoent. It provides an overview of the hierarchical structure of all blocks in the editor. The blocks are presented vertically one below the other. It enables editing of hierarchy and addition of elements in the block tree without selecting the block instance on the canvas.

It is an experimental component which may end up completely merged into the ListView component via configuration props.
