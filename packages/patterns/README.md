# Patterns

> **Note**
> This package is currently only used internally by the Gutenberg project to manage the creation and editing of user patterns using the `wp_block` CPT in the context of the block editor. The likes of the `PatternsMenuItems` component expect to be rendered within a `BlockEditorProvider` in order to work.
