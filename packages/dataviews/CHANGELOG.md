## Unreleased

### Enhancement

- DataViews now supports multi-selection. A new set of filter operators has been introduced: `is`, `isNot`, `isAny`, `isNone`. Single-selection operators are `is` and `isNot`, and multi-selection operators are `isAny` and `isNone`. If no operators are declared for a filter, it will support multi-selection. Additionally, the old filter operators `in` and `notIn` operators have been deprecated and will work as `is` and `isNot` respectively. Please, migrate to the new operators as they'll be removed soon.
