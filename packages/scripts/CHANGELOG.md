-   The `env` family of scripts has been removed. Finally, exceeded in functionality and replaced by [`wp-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env).
-   The default Babel configuration has changed to only support stage-4 proposals. This affects the `build` and `start` commands that use the bundled Babel configuration; if a project provides its own, this change doesn't affect it ([#22083](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/22083)).
-   The bundled `wp-prettier` dependency has been upgraded from `1.19.1` to `2.0.5`. Refer to the [Prettier 2.0 "2020" blog post](https://prettier.io/blog/2020/03/21/2.0.0.html) for full details about the major changes included in Prettier 2.0.

## 10.0.0 (2020-05-28)

### New Feature

-   New `--webpack-bundle-analyzer` flag added to `build` and `start` scripts. It enables visualization for the size of webpack output files with an interactive zoomable treemap ([#22310](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/22310)).
-   New `--webpack--devtool` flag added to `start` script. It controls how source maps are generated. See options at https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/#devtool ([#22310](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/22310)).
-   The `test-e2e` and `test-unit` scripts will now disambiguate custom configurations, preferring a `jest-e2e.config.js`, `jest-e2e.config.json`, `jest-unit.config.js`, or `jest-unit.config.json` Jest configuration file if present, falling back to `jest.config.js` or `jest.config.json`. This allows for configurations which should only apply to one or the other test variant.

## 9.1.0 (2020-05-14)

### New Features

-   Add new capability to `build` and `start` scripts that automates handling CSS, SASS or SCSS files by importing them from JavaScript code ([#21730](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/21730)). You can find more details about CSS assets management in webpack at https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/#loading-css.

### Enhancements

-   Bundle analysis in `build` script now runs with module concatenation disabled. This represents the size of individual modules more accurately, at the cost of not providing an exact byte-for-byte match to the final size in the production chunk.

### Deprecations

-   `env` script was marked as deprecated. We recommend using `@wordpress/env` package instead that lets you easily set up a local WordPress environment for building and testing plugins and themes.

## 9.0.0 (2020-04-30)

### Breaking Changes

-   The bundled `puppeteer` (`^2.0.0`) dependency has been replaced with `puppeteer-core` in version `3.0.0`. Puppeteer uses Chromium v81 instead of Chromium v79. See the [full list of changes](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/releases/tag/v3.0.0). It also allowed preventing Chromium installation together with `@wordpress/scripts`. It happens now on-demand when running `test-e2e` script, and it re-triggers only when a new version is required.

Tests can be debugged by any [inspector client](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/#inspector-clients) that supports the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) using the `--inspect-brk` option.
-   Add debugging support for `test-e2e` script ([#21861](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/21861)). Tests can be debugged by using the `--inspect-brk` option and a new `--puppeteer-devtools` option (or `PUPPETEER_DEVTOOLS="true"` environment variable).

### Bug fix

-   The bundled `npm-package-json-lint` dependency has been updated from requiring `^4.0.3` to requiring `^5.0.0` ([#21597](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/21597)). [Breaking changes](https://npmpackagejsonlint.org/docs/en/v4-to-v5) don't break anything in this package. It fixes the abrupt shutdown when `"description"` field in `package.json` is empty.
-   Update `check-licenses` script to parse JSON dependency tree recursively so sub-dependencies of packages passed in `--ignore` flag are ignored as well.

## 8.0.0 (2020-04-15)

### Breaking Changes

-   The bundled `jest` dependency has been updated from requiring `^24.9.0` to requiring `^25.3.0` (see [Breaking Changes](https://jestjs.io/blog/2020/01/21/jest-25), [#20766](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/20766)).

## 7.2.0 (2020-04-01)

### Enhancements

-   Incompatibility between `@svgr/webpack` in version `4.3.3` and `url-loader` in version `3.0.0` was fixed by bumping `@svgr/webpack` to `^5.2.0`.
-   All webpack dependencies got minor version update if applicable.

### Internal

-   Package depends now on the shared Prettier config exposed in `@wordpress/prettier-config` dependency ([#20026](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/20026)).

## 7.1.2 (2020-02-25)

### Bug Fixes

-   Ensure `packages-update` work when `dependencies` or `devDependencies` are missing in the `package.json` file ([#20408](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/20408)).

## 7.1.0 (2020-02-10)

### Bug Fixes

-   Ensure the default Prettier config is used in the `lint-js` script when no Prettier config is found in the project ([#20071](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/20071)).

## 7.0.0 (2020-02-04)

-   Add `lint-md-js` script to lint JavaScript source code in markdown files, uses the `eslint-plugin-markdown` plugin ([#19518](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/19518)).
-   Add `lint-md-docs` script to lint the markup of markdown files, uses the `markdownlint` module ([#19855](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/19855)).
-   Add `packages-update` script to update WordPress packages to the latest version automatically ([#19448](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/19448)).

### Bug Fixes
